# Hand Grip Posture Classification for Amputees

## Overview

This repository provides a robust solution for the classification of hand grip postures in amputees. The methodology involves the use of Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging EMG (Electromyography) signal analysis, we extract time-frequency features and generate a dataset of images using advanced data augmentation techniques.

## Key Features

- **Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT):** Utilize CWT for time-frequency analysis of EMG signals.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Employ CNNs for effective image-based classification.
- **EMG Signal Analysis:** Extract informative features from Electromyography signals.
- **Data Augmentation Techniques:** Enhance the dataset through augmentation for robust model training.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure that your EMG dataset is properly formatted.
   - Implement data augmentation techniques to diversify the dataset.

2. **Continuous Wavelet Transform:**
   - Use the provided scripts to apply CWT on the EMG signals.

3. **Convolutional Neural Networks:**
   - Train and evaluate CNN models using the preprocessed CWT images.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
